## Compatibility

- Ember.js v3.20 or above
- Ember CLI v3.20 or above
- Node.js v12 or above

## Installation

```sh
ember install ember-ionicons
```

## Usage

Each Ionicon is available as a component:

```

Caveats right now:

1. _All_ of the icons are defined; there are a lot of them, and they are not tree-shaken
